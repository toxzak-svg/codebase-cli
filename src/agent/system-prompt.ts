 * sessions. Dynamic environment context is delivered separately via
 * buildEnvironmentReminder() and prepended to the user's first turn.
 *
 * Layered as:
 *   1. Identity + verbs the agent can perform
 *   2. Behavior rules (anti-patterns, verification, system-reminder semantics)
 *   3. Task-checklist policy when create_task/update_task are available
 *   4. Available tools, auto-built from the registered tool set
 *
 * Deliberately short — most agents see ~600-1000 tokens of prompt, not
 * 6000+. The bullets are concrete things-to-avoid rather than
 * vibes-prompts; concrete rules bind model behavior, vague ones don't.
